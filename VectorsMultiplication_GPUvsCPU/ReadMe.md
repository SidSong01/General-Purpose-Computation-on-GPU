# Overview

The dot product of two vectors $a=(a_1, a_2, ... a_n-1)$ and $𝑏 = (𝑏_1, 𝑏_2, …,𝑏_n-1)$, written 𝑎 ∙ 𝑏, is simply the sum of the component-by-component products: $$a\cdotsb$$

CUDA code to compute in parallel the dot product of two (N = 1024*1024) random single precision floating point vectors.
